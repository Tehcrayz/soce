The text defines the loss of complex motor skills as making it difficult to perform tasks like shooting while on the move. Page: 194"},
{"q":"The OODA Loop is a decision cycle to help manage survival stress. What does OODA stand for?","c":["Observe, Orient, Decide, Act.","Orient, Observe, Direct, Act.","Observe, Order, Dominate, Act.","Orient, Decide, Observe, Attack."],"a":"0","e":"The correct answer is Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. This is the sequence of the decision-making loop described in the text. Page: 194"},
{"q":"Which step of the OODA loop involves sorting through what is observed and focusing on what is really important?","c":["Observe.","Orient.","Decide.","Act."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Orient. The \"Orient\" phase is defined as sorting \"through what is observed and focus[ing] on what is really important.\" Page: 194"},
{"q":"All of the following are listed as possible sources of stress during an active shooter incident EXCEPT:","c":["The smell of smoke or blood.","People running, screaming, or pleading for help.","The presence of other armed responders from different agencies.","Loud alarms and flashing lights."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is The presence of other armed responders from different agencies. While this can create a tactical challenge (positive target identification), it is not listed as a source of survival stress in the provided list. The other options are all explicitly mentioned. Page: 195"},
{"q":"During an active threat incident, what is the officer's primary focus?","c":["To stop and help wounded victims immediately.","To establish a secure perimeter and wait for backup.","To stop the active threat/shooter before they can kill more people.","To gather intelligence on the shooter's motives."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is To stop the active threat/shooter before they can kill more people. The text states to \"Avoid the urge to stop and help those who are wounded or scared until the threat has been stopped, since your primary focus is to stop the active threat/shooter.\" Page: 195"},
{"q":"The principle of tactical response that involves using unrestricted speed, strength, surprise, and aggression to stop the threat is known as:","c":["Immediate response.","Direct-to-threat clearing.","Violence of action.","Positive target identification."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Violence of action. This principle is defined as using \"unrestricted speed, strength, surprise, and aggression to stop the threat.\" Page: 195"},
{"q":"Direct-to-threat clearing means an officer should:","c":["Methodically clear every room to find the threat.","Bypass all doors and rooms if the location of the threat is known.","Always follow the flow of the crowd to find victims.","Both Methodically clear every room to find the threat. and Always follow the flow of the crowd to find victims."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Bypass all doors and rooms if the location of the threat is known. This principle prioritizes moving directly to the known threat location over a slow, methodical search. Page: 195"},
{"q":"When scanning and recognizing threats at a scene, a person who holds a nonthreatening posture and has been visually cleared of weapons should be considered a:","c":["Hold or assess.","Shoot.","Pass.","Accomplice."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Pass. The text defines a \"pass\" as \"a person who holds a nonthreatening posture and has been visually cleared of weapons.\" Page: 196"},
{"q":"A person who poses a fear of attack and does not assume a surrender position or nonthreatening posture should be considered a:","c":["Pass.","Hold or assess.","Shoot.","Bystander."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Hold or assess. This category is for individuals who are not an immediate, identified active shooter but whose posture and actions are still potentially threatening. Page: 196"},
{"q":"The category of shoot applies to an active threat/active shooter that has been identified and recognized as:","c":["Being willing to negotiate.","Having an unknown number of accomplices.","Not being able to be safely and immediately captured or contained by lesser means.","Being in possession of a firearm."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Not being able to be safely and immediately captured or contained by lesser means. This is the specific justification provided for categorizing a subject as a \"shoot\" threat. Page: 196"},
{"q":"What is the first tactic to use immediately after neutralizing a threat?","c":["Provide first aid to the threat.","Self-check for injuries.","Assess 360° security for other threats.","Communicate with responding backup."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Assess 360° security for other threats. Before any other action, the officer must ensure there are no other immediate threats in the vicinity. Page: 196"},
{"q":"What are the three tactics to use immediately after neutralizing a threat and assessing 360° security?","c":["Communicate, provide first aid, and secure evidence.","Self-check, communicate with backup, and provide first aid.","Provide first aid, reload, and set a perimeter.","Reload, self-check, and communicate with backup."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Self-check, communicate with backup, and provide first aid. These are the three steps listed to be performed after the initial 360° security assessment. Page: 196"},
{"q":"What is a key mental preparation strategy for an active threat encounter?","c":["Reading news stories about past incidents.","Mentally rehearsing possible scenarios and your response to each one.","Focusing only on physical training and ignoring mental aspects.","Believing that it is unlikely to ever happen to you."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Mentally rehearsing possible scenarios and your response to each one. The text recommends getting \"in the head-space to confront such a threat by mentally rehearsing possible scenarios.\" Page: 194"},
{"q":"In a deadly force encounter, it is not uncommon to lose your fine motor skills, which makes which of the following tasks difficult?","c":["Running or taking cover.","Basic firearms manipulation or aiming.","Yelling clear, verbal commands.","Assessing the situation for threats."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Basic firearms manipulation or aiming. The text gives these as specific examples of small, precise movements that become difficult with the loss of fine motor skills. Page: 194"},
{"q":"All of the following are listed as principles of tactical response EXCEPT:","c":["Noise discipline.","Violence of action.","Perimeter containment.","Immediate response."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Perimeter containment. While setting a perimeter is a standard police tactic, it is not listed as one of the core principles for an immediate tactical response to an active shooter, which prioritizes moving directly to the threat. Page: 195"},
{"q":"The ability to assess a situation or subject during an active threat depends largely on your:","c":["Marksmanship skills.","Observation skills.","Communication skills.","Physical fitness."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Observation skills. The text states, \"The ability to assess a situation or subject depends largely on your observation skills.\" Page: 193"},
{"q":"What strategy can an officer use to help manage the effects of survival stress?","c":["Take slow, deep breaths.","Keep your head and eyes moving.","Use the OODA loop decision cycle.","All answers listed."],"a":"3","e":"The correct answer is All answers listed. The text lists all three as strategies to help manage survival stress. Page: 194"},
{"q":"Due to the fast-paced nature of active threat incidents, officers must prepare themselves mentally to confront the threat as a:","c":["Member of a large response team.","Single responder.","Supervisor in charge of the scene.","Bystander until SWAT arrives."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Single responder. The text states, \"you must prepare yourself mentally to confront an active threat/shooter as a single responder at any given time. Always assume that you will respond alone...\" Page: 193"},
{"q":"The principle of positive target identification is critical to:","c":["Move quickly through a building.","Avoid shooting additional armed responders, such as officers from other agencies.","Ensure you are using proper sight alignment.","Justify the use of deadly force after the incident."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Avoid shooting additional armed responders, such as officers from other agencies. This principle emphasizes the need to correctly identify the actual shooter and avoid tragic blue-on-blue situations. Page: 195"},
{"q":"When under immense stress, you may need to rely more heavily on your gross motor skills, which involve actions performed by:","c":["Your fingers and hands.","Your eyes and ears.","Your large or major muscles.","Your entire squad."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Your large or major muscles. Gross motor skills demand more from large muscles to perform actions like running or taking cover, which may remain functional when fine motor skills have degraded. Page: 194"},
{"q":"Observing where people are running away from can help an officer:","c":["Find the safest exit.","Reveal the location of the threat.","Locate wounded victims who need aid.","All answers listed."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Reveal the location of the threat. The text suggests monitoring the flow of the crowd as a way to gather intelligence on the threat's location as part of direct-to-threat clearing. Page: 195"},
{"q":"The Observe phase of the OODA loop involves:","c":["Making a decision based on what is important.","Taking in information using the senses.","Sorting through information to find what is important.","Taking appropriate action."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Taking in information using the senses. \"Observe\" is the initial information-gathering phase of the loop. Page: 194"},
{"q":"Noise discipline as a principle of tactical response means:","c":["Using loud verbal commands to control bystanders.","Ignoring loud alarms and other sounds.","Using the element of surprise by moving quietly.","Firing your weapon to create a distraction."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Using the element of surprise by moving quietly. This principle is about minimizing the sound you make to maintain a tactical advantage. Page: 195"},
{"q":"Why is understanding the physiological changes of survival stress important for an officer?","c":["It helps reduce anxiety and stabilize motor skills.","It heightens situational awareness.","It improves the ability to react decisively.","All answers listed."],"a":"3","e":"The correct answer is All answers listed. The text states that understanding these changes helps manage them, which in turn reduces anxiety, stabilizes motor skills, heightens awareness, and improves reaction. Page: 193"},
{"q":"The term immediate response means an officer should prepare to respond with:","c":["Only standard-issue equipment.","A fully assembled tactical team.","What they have on their person or what is immediately available.","Verbal commands before any other action."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is What they have on their person or what is immediately available. This principle emphasizes that an officer cannot wait for ideal equipment or backup and must be prepared to act with what they currently have. Page: 195"},
{"q":"In the worst-case situations of survival stress, an officer may suffer a complete breakdown of all motor skills, causing them to:","c":["Become overly aggressive.","Experience amplified hearing.","Freeze up and be incapable of taking action.","Forget their training."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Freeze up and be incapable of taking action. The text describes this as a potential symptom in worst-case scenarios of survival stress. Page: 194"},
{"q":"After neutralizing a threat, which action comes first?","c":["Self-check for injuries.","Assess 360° security.","Communicate with backup.","Provide first aid to victims."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Assess 360° security. This is the first of the four listed tactics to use immediately after neutralizing a threat, ensuring the scene is secure before other actions are taken. Page: 196"}
