{"q":"Which of the following are considered job-specific documents that outline how to handle daily responsibilities and operations?","c":["Emergency Plans","Post Orders","Incident Command Systems (ICS)","Evacuation Guidelines"],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Post Orders. Post orders are defined as \"job-specific documents that outline how to handle daily responsibilities and operations\". Emergency plans, ICS, and evacuation guidelines serve different, though related, purposes. Page: 255"},
{"q":"When responding to an emergency, your first priority is the:","c":["Preservation of evidence.","Documentation of the incident.","Safety and security of everyone.","Immediate resolution of the issue."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Safety and security of everyone. The text explicitly states, \"Your first priority is the safety and security of everyone\". While other options are important duties, the primary focus is on safety and security. Page: 255"},
{"q":"Emergencies often occur because of all the following reasons EXCEPT:","c":["A disturbance","A disaster","A planned tactical drill","An escape attempt"],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is A planned tactical drill. The material states that emergencies often occur because of \"a disturbance, a disaster, or an escape attempt\". A planned drill is a controlled exercise, not an emergency. Page: 255"},
{"q":"When verifying an emergency, what information should you be prepared to communicate to the control room?","c":["The number of people involved and the nature of any injuries.","The location of the emergency.","Whether hazardous materials or weapons are involved.","All listed answers."],"a":"3","e":"The correct answer is All listed answers. An officer must be prepared to give comprehensive information, including the number of people involved, nature of any injuries, the location of the emergency, and if hazardous materials or weapons are involved. Page: 255"},
{"q":"What is the systematic approach to command, control, and coordination of an emergency response that conveys emergencies to designated persons or authorities?","c":["Chain of Command","Incident Command System (ICS)","Command Post Protocol","Post Orders"],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Incident Command System (ICS). The Incident Command System (ICS) is defined as \"a systematic approach to command, control, and coordinate an emergency response\". The chain of command defines authority, but ICS is the system for managing the response. Page: 256"},
{"q":"Which of the following is NOT a recommended guideline to follow during an evacuation?","c":["Conduct an inmate count when reaching the evacuation area.","Give clear and concise commands.","Use elevators for rapid evacuation of non-ambulatory individuals.","Obtain copies of inmate rosters for identification and counting."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Use elevators for rapid evacuation of non-ambulatory individuals. The text explicitly states, \"Do not use elevators for evacuation\". All other options are listed as standard evacuation guidelines. Page: 256"},
{"q":"Tasks that may be assigned to an officer during an emergency include:","c":["Setting perimeters and applying use of force.","Using a radio to communicate.","Conducting evacuations.","All listed answer."],"a":"3","e":"The correct answer is All listed answers. The text lists \"setting perimeters, using a radio to communicate, conducting evacuations, and applying use of force\" as tasks assigned during an emergency. Page: 255"},
{"q":"In the context of an emergency, chain of command is best defined as:","c":["A list of officers designated to use lethal force.","The order of authority and responsibility that outlines the coordination of resources.","The sequence of reporting followed for non-emergency incidents only.","A communication network used exclusively by supervisory staff."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is The order of authority and responsibility that outlines the coordination of resources. Chain of command is defined as \"the order of authority and responsibility that joins one level of an organization to another, and that outlines the coordination of resources in an emergency situation\". Page: 258"},
{"q":"Who is considered the person in charge at the initial onset of an emergency scene?","c":["The highest-ranking officer on shift.","The officer assigned to the control room.","The first person on the scene until relieved by command staff.","The supervisor of the area where the emergency occurred."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is The first person on the scene until relieved by command staff. The material is very specific: \"As the first person on the scene, however, you begin the chain of command. Until relieved by the command staff, you are considered the person in charge and must make decisions\". Page: 258"},
{"q":"When establishing a perimeter, an officer may use which of the following structures?","c":["Internal gates and sally ports.","Roll gates and doors.","Cross fences.","All listed answers."],"a":"3","e":"The correct answer is All listed answers. The text states that setting up a perimeter involves using structures like \"internal gates, sally ports, roll gates, doors, and cross fences\". Page: 256"},
{"q":"The process of defusing a situation and returning the facility to normal operations is known as:","c":["Deactivation","Debriefing","Resolving the incident","Setting a perimeter"],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Resolving the incident. \"Resolving an incident or emergency involves defusing the situation and returning the facility to normal operations\". Debriefing is a post-incident activity, but \"resolving\" encompasses the entire process of ending the emergency. Page: 257"},
{"q":"When documenting an emergency, all of the following details should be included EXCEPT:","c":["The date, time, and place of the incident.","The officer's personal opinion on the cause of the emergency.","The time outside agencies were contacted.","The scope, nature, and status of the emergency."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is The officer's personal opinion on the cause of the emergency. Documentation must be factual and objective. The list of required information includes date, time, place, people involved, agency contact times, and the scope, nature, and status of the emergency. Personal opinions are not part of a professional report. Page: 259"},
{"q":"A strategic point away from the emergency where the person in command and staff make all major decisions is called a:","c":["Staging Area","Control Room","Command Post","Safe Zone"],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Command Post. A command post is defined as a \"strategic point away from an emergency\" where command staff \"will receive all communications and make all major decisions during an incident or emergency\". Page: 258"},
{"q":"An officer's roles in resolving an emergency can include which of the following?","c":["Providing first aid and recording events.","Serving as an adjucator in investigations and debriefing.","Transporting, escorting, and supervising people.","Both Transporting, escorting, and supervising people and Providing first aid and recording events are correct."],"a":"3","e":"The correct answer is . The text lists transport, escort and supervise people, use physical force, provide first aid, record events, serve as a witness, and debrief. Page: 257"},
{"q":"To reduce liability while resolving emergencies, you must do which of the following?","c":["Respond within the scope of your training.","Observe your surroundings and take note of activities as they occur.","Use reasonable judgment in responding, while practicing officer safety.","All listed answers."],"a":"3","e":"The correct answer is All listed answers. The text explicitly lists all three actions as necessary to reduce liability: \"observe your surroundings, take note of activities as they occur, respond within the scope of your training, and use reasonable judgment in responding, while practicing officer safety\". Page: 257"},
{"q":"Which statement about the chain of command during an emergency is most accurate?","c":["It is a rigid structure that cannot be altered regardless of who is on the scene.","The first officer on the scene begins the chain of command.","Only supervisory staff are considered part of the chain of command.","It is suspended during emergencies in favor of the ICS."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is The first officer on the scene begins the chain of command. The material emphasizes that \"As the first person on the scene, however, you begin the chain of command\". This makes the officer on scene the initial point of authority. Page: 258"},
{"q":"During an evacuation, you must account for:","c":["All inmates only.","All on-duty staff and inmates.","Everyone who was in the facility, including staff, visitors, and inmates.","Everyone in the immediate evacuation area."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Everyone who was in the facility, including staff, visitors, and inmates. The guidelines are specific: \"Account for everyone who was in the facility\". This is more inclusive than just inmates or on-duty staff. Page: 256"},
{"q":"What is the primary reason to isolate an emergency situation?","c":["To make documentation easier.","To establish a clear chain of command.","To prevent it from spreading to other areas.","To identify the person in charge."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is To prevent it from spreading to other areas. The text states, \"Secure and isolate the situation so that it does not spread to other areas\". This is the main purpose of isolation and setting a perimeter. Page: 256"},
{"q":"When must an officer submit a report about an emergency?","c":["Only when directly involved in resolving the incident.","Only when designated as the primary reporting officer.","Only when physical force is used.","Even if not directly involved, a report must be submitted about what was observed."],"a":"3","e":"The correct answer is Even if not directly involved, a report must be submitted about what was observed. The text notes, \"Although you may not be directly involved in an emergency, you must submit a report about what you observed\". Page: 258"},
{"q":"What is a key feature of a command post during an emergency?","c":["It is always located in the facility's main control room.","It may use radio bands or communication devices designated specifically for the emergency.","It is accessible to all staff members regardless of their role.","It is established only for disasters, not for disturbances or riots."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is It may use radio bands or communication devices designated specifically for the emergency. The text states, \"People in the command post may use radio bands or other communication devices designated specifically for them, separate from the non-emergency devices\". Page: 258"},
{"q":"Properly responding to an incident or emergency requires all of the following EXCEPT:","c":["A variety of procedures and techniques.","Knowledge of facility layout and evacuation routes.","Independent decision-making that ignores the emergency plan.","The ability to stay flexible and adapt to changes."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Independent decision-making that ignores the emergency plan. Officers are expected to recall and follow the agency's emergency plan, not ignore it. The other options are all part of a proper response. Page: 255"},
{"q":"According to the evacuation guidelines, what action should be taken regarding windows and doors along evacuation routes?","c":["They must always be left open to vent smoke.","They must always be closed and locked to contain the threat.","They should be closed or opened if so directed, if time permits.","They should be ignored to focus solely on moving people."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is They should be closed or opened if so directed, if time permits. The guideline is conditional: \"Close or open windows and doors, if so directed, along evacuation routes if time permits\". This shows that the action depends on the situation and directions from a supervisor. Page: 256"},
{"q":"Why is it important for an emergency report to be complete and accurate?","c":["Because it is the only document reviewed by the debriefing team.","To ensure the officer receives proper credit for their actions.","Because it may be needed for reference during an investigation or for other purposes.","To provide a template for future post orders."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Because it may be needed for reference during an investigation or for other purposes. The text states, \"Reports should be complete and accurate, as they may be needed for reference during an investigation or for other purposes\". Page: 259"},
{"q":"The staff members responsible for keeping all other staff updated about the status of an emergency are the:","c":["First officer on the scene.","Control room staff.","Command post staff.","Individual officers involved in the response."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Command post staff. The material specifies that \"The person in command on the scene will be responsible for keeping staff members updated about the status of the emergency,\" and that the command post staff \"will receive all communications and make all major decisions\". Page: 258"},
{"q":"A facility-wide lockdown may be required for which of the following situations?","c":["An inmate suicide.","An argument between two inmates.","A scheduled inmate count.","Both an inmate suicide and an argument between two inmates."],"a":"0","e":"The correct answer is An inmate suicide. The text uses an inmate suicide as a specific example of an incident that \"may require a facility-wide lockdown\". A minor argument would likely not require such an extensive measure. Page: 256"},
{"q":"Which action is critical after moving people to a safe location during an evacuation?","c":["Immediately beginning the debriefing process.","Conducting an inmate count.","Securing all emergency equipment.","Notifying the media."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is Conducting an inmate count. The evacuation guidelines explicitly list \"Conduct an inmate count when reaching the evacuation area\" and \"Account for everyone who was in the facility\". This is a critical step for accountability. Page: 256"},
{"q":"To properly assess the threat of an emergency, you should use:","c":["Discretion and caution.","Only the information provided by inmates.","Your intuition, regardless of the emergency plan.","The same level of response for every incident."],"a":"0","e":"The correct answer is Discretion and caution. When verifying an emergency, an officer must \"properly assess the threat while using discretion and caution as you approach the scene\". Page: 255"},
{"q":"An officer's responsibilities include the care, custody, and control of inmates, as well as the:","c":["Safety of staff and visitors.","Security of the facility.","Both security of the facility and safety of staff and visitors.","Management of the command post."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Both security of the facility and safety of staff and visitors. The text states, \"You are responsible for the care, custody, and control of inmates, safety of staff and visitors, and security of the facility\". Page: 255"},
{"q":"What is the primary function of the Incident Command System (ICS)?","c":["To document daily post orders for staff.","To provide a systematic approach to command, control, and coordinate a response.","To conduct post-incident debriefings and investigations.","To train officers in the use of non-lethal equipment."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is To provide a systematic approach to command, control, and coordinate a response. The definition provided states ICS is \"a systematic approach to command, control, and coordinate an emergency response\". Page: 256"},
{"q":"Information to be included when documenting an emergency includes the time people arrived and left, and:","c":["A description of the weather at the time.","The time outside agencies were contacted.","A list of all previous emergencies at the facility.","The personal contact information of all witnesses."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is The time outside agencies were contacted. The list of required documentation details explicitly includes \"what time outside agencies, such as emergency services, were contacted\". The other options are not mentioned in this specific list. Page: 259"},
{"q":"When determining the level of response assistance needed, an officer must first try to identify the type of emergency, which could include all of the following EXCEPT:","c":["Medical","Fire","Administrative review","Criminal act"],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is Administrative review. The text lists \"medical, fire, hazmat, or criminal act\" as types of emergencies to identify. An administrative review is a procedural action, not a type of acute emergency requiring an immediate response. Page: 260"},
{"q":"What factor is most critical in determining the type and level of response needed for an incident?","c":["The number of officers on duty.","The time of day the incident occurs.","The severity of the incident.","The location of available equipment."],"a":"2","e":"The correct answer is The severity of the incident. The material explicitly states, \"The severity of an incident determines what type and level of response is needed\". Page: 260"},
{"q":"An inmate intentionally starting a fight in the dayroom to draw officers away from a perimeter fence where another inmate plans to escape is an example of:","c":["A spontaneous criminal act.","An emergency created as a distraction.","A failure to follow post orders.","An equipment malfunction."],"a":"1","e":"The correct answer is An emergency created as a distraction. The text notes, \"Inmates can intentionally create emergencies as distractions to accomplish other purposes. For example, inmates could use a fight as a distraction during an escape attempt\". Page: 260"},
